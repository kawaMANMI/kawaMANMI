ðŸ‘‹ Highly driven, motivated, and analytical data professional. Current participant in Tech Talent Academyâ€™s Data Academy programme learning and developing Python fundamentals, including key data science libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, SciKit, and Tensorflow. In addition to this I am gaining a solid grounding in machine learning algorithms, relational database management (SQL), data visualisation/business intelligence packages such as PowerBI, and R programming language. I am a keen and adaptable worker looking for entry level data science positions that will utilise this skillset.

ðŸ‘‹I  have  completed a 12-week Bootcamp course (Dec 2021 - Mar 2022) in Analysing Data, a Skills Bootcamp delivered via Babington. Through attendance on programme, involved 135 hours of study both via instructor lead training & self-directed learning, I have developed a level 3 equivalent skill set across data literacy, understanding data driven software: Excel, PowerBI, analysing & interpreting data and presenting data. After completion I obtained certification via uCertify Excel 2019 certification, covering: manage workbook options and settings, manage and format data, create advanced formulas and macros and manage advanced charts and tables.



ðŸ‘‹ In academia, obtained PhD in Applied Mathematics from the University of Birmingham in 2015. 
   I have experience in lecturing mathematical and computer programming modules, researching and 
    supervising postgradtuate studenties particularly in numerical modelling fluid dynamics.
    My plan is to utilise my mathematical, computer code and technical skills to become a valuable asset.

ðŸ‘€ I have passion for computer coding in number of scientific computer language, Data Analysis, 
    continuous learning mathematical and technical skills and problem-solving.

ðŸŒ± An intensive 14-week course (Feb 2022 - Jun 2022), focused on the fundamentals of data science delivered through a combination of interactive group learning and home learning tasks. During the course I built strong skills in the manipulation of data using Numpy and Pandas whilst being able to visualise the data using Python libraries including matplotlib, Altair and other software packages such as Power BI.
